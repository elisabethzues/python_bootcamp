# python_bootcamp
Bootcamp for learning python

This is a collection of ipython/jupyter notebooks to start learning python. As the name says it is a bootcamp. I doesn't expect you to know everything but it isn't a ponyfarm trip either. There are some advanced concepts in there and sometimes you might have to do some additional reading if something is badly or insufficiently explained (sorry). If you stick with it, you will have learned some useful language snippets by the end and get an idea of some of the concepts behind most programming languages that trip up many beginners.

The first few levels of the python codeacademy are actually great for beginners, and I recommend at least having a look at those too!
